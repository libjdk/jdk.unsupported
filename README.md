[**libjdk**](https://github.com/libjdk/libjdk) is a comprehensive C++ implementation of the Java Development Kit (JDK), providing native C++ libraries that mirror the functionality of Java's core libraries and modules. While it provides Java-like APIs, it runs as native C++ code without requiring a Java Virtual Machine.

- Java Native Interface (JNI)
- Java Native Access (JNA)
- Java Security Manager
- Java Runtime Permission
- Java System Properties
- Java System Environment Variables
